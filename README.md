## Collaborate

Feel free to collaborate / edit the `data/craftable.json` if you want. I'll be happy to merge your PR.

## What's next

I plan on:

- improving the UI
  - making it responsive
  - making it easier to see the different steps of the crafting process (eg. seeing what ressources need to be crafted)
  - making it easier to see the different options for craft that have multiples recipes
  - maybe use an autocomplete field
  - better styles
- adding parameters in the url to share the current state of the calculator / save it / making it persistent when you reload
- adding a way to add several crafts in a sort of craft list
- upgrade to next 13
- clean the code
