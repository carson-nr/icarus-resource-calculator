## Collaborate

Feel free to collaborate / edit the `data/craftable.json` if you want. I'll be happy to merge your PR.

If you have an issue when trying to calculate something, please open an issue and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
To help me, you can click the Icarus icon on the page then press F12 to open the console and follow the instructions.

## What's next

I plan on:

- improving the UI
  - making it responsive
  - making it easier to see the different steps of the crafting process (eg. seeing what ressources need to be crafted)
  - making it easier to see the different options for craft that have multiples recipes
  - maybe use an autocomplete field
  - better styles
- adding parameters in the url to share the current state of the calculator / save it / making it persistent when you reload
- adding a way to add several crafts in a sort of craft list
- upgrade to next 13
- clean the code
